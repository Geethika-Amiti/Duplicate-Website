<h1>
Books Build Confidence
</h1>

Another reason that highlights the importance of books in our life, is that books help in building our confidence. When we read a book, we get to learn about the struggles and hardships of various characters. Sometimes we even relate those situations to our personal lives. Understanding the situations of the characters of a book and how they overcome difficult times and challenges gives you the courage and confidence to deal with your problems. Also, a well-read person will always have more knowledge about various topics that will equip that person better for social situations and for holding conversations with groups of people.
